Title: The Lion and Albert
Author: Marriott Edgar
There's a famous seaside place called Blackpool,
That's noted for fresh air and fun,
And Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom
Went there with young Albert, their son.
A grand little lad was young Albert,
All dressed in his best; quite a swell
With a stick with an 'orse's 'ead 'andle,
The finest that Woolworth's could sell.
They didn't think much to the Ocean:
The waves, they was fiddlin' and small,
There was no wrecks and nobody drownded,
Fact, nothing to laugh at at all.
So, seeking for further amusement,
They paid and went into the Zoo,
Where they'd Lions and Tigers and Camels,
And old ale and sandwiches too.
There were one great big Lion called Wallace;
His nose were all covered with scars —
He lay in a somnolent posture,
With the side of his face on the bars.
Now Albert had heard about Lions,
How they was ferocious and wild  —
To see Wallace lying so peaceful,
Well, it didn't seem right to the child.
So straightway the brave little feller,
Not showing a morsel of fear,
Took his stick with its 'orse's 'ead 'andle
And pushed it in Wallace's ear.
You could see that the Lion didn't like it,
For giving a kind of a roll,
He pulled Albert inside the cage with 'im,
And swallowed the little lad 'ole.
Then Pa, who had seen the occurrence,
And didn't know what to do next,
Said 'Mother! Yon Lion's 'et Albert',
And Mother said 'Well, I am vexed!'
Then Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom —
Quite rightly, when all's said and done —
Complained to the Animal Keeper,
That the Lion had eaten their son.
The keeper was quite nice about it;
He said 'What a nasty mishap.
Are you sure that it's your boy he's eaten?'
Pa said "Am I sure? There's his cap!'
The manager had to be sent for.
He came and he said 'What's to do?'
Pa said 'Yon Lion's 'et Albert,
'And 'im in his Sunday clothes, too.'
Then Mother said, 'Right's right, young feller;
I think it's a shame and a sin,
For a lion to go and eat Albert,
And after we've paid to come in.'
The manager wanted no trouble,
He took out his purse right away,
Saying 'How much to settle the matter?'
And Pa said "What do you usually pay?'
But Mother had turned a bit awkward
When she thought where her Albert had gone.
She said 'No! someone's got to be summonsed' —
So that was decided upon.
Then off they went to the P'lice Station,
In front of the Magistrate chap;
They told 'im what happened to Albert,
And proved it by showing his cap.
The Magistrate gave his opinion
That no one was really to blame
And he said that he hoped the Ramsbottoms
Would have further sons to their name.
At that Mother got proper blazing,
'And thank you, sir, kindly,' said she.
'What waste all our lives raising children
To feed ruddy Lions? Not me!'

Title: Resonance of Verdant Verse
Author: Jimmy J. Jones
In twilight's realm, a whispered symphony,
caresses the air, in subtle delight,
like butterflies in graceful harmony,
words dance and sing, in rhythmic flight.

Oh, in Neruda's wake, we shall embark,
through verdant landscapes of poetic refrain,
where passions ignite and emotions spark,
and the heart's desires are etched like stained glass pane.

Together, we'll paint vivid scenes anew,
unfolding stories within nature's domain,
where emerald forests and skies of cobalt blue,
witness verses bloom, like wildflowers in rain.

No trite clichés or worn-out phrases here,
for in our words, authenticity takes hold,
sincere expressions, heartfelt and clear,
as love's tapestry we carefully unfold.

Let us wander, enraptured, through pristine lands,
where mountains stand resolute and tall,
and the whispers of the wind, with gentle hands,
compose ballads that echo through it all.

Through verse, let's unveil nature's enchanting lore,
from babbling brooks to ancient trees,
each line a portal to worlds that we adore,
capturing the essence of life's sweet reverie.

Neruda's spirit, forever enshrined,
in the ink that flows from quill to page,
may our words honor his legacy, defined,
as we carry his wisdom, age after age.

In this ode to his illustrious refrain,
we strive to capture the essence divine,
with every line penned, a heartfelt gain,
in homage to Neruda's timeless design.

So, let our voices merge and intertwine,
imbued with passion, grace, and pure delight,
as we craft verses that stand the test of time,
and resonate with readers, morning to night.

Title: Splendor of the Storm
Author: wolfdrummer13
I stand outside in the tempest,

clothes billowing, cloak whipping in the wind,

my body swaying and rocking in the gale

as the heavens burst asunder

and disgorge their incredible payload.



My heart swells with exhilaration at nature's glory,

the raw power she wields

in such a fantastic display

invigorating, tremendous to behold.



Lightning flashes all around,

a flurry of bolts lashing out at the sky;

thunder booms and rolls

through the air and earth,

shaking the ground with its potency.



I marvel at the purity of it all -

of the lightning as it travels the abyss above;

of the thunder as it quakes the bedrock below;

the sky as the dark, roiling clouds churn;

the rain as it drives down,

sheet after sheet, drop after drop,

glistening in a sheen on my face

as I stare upwards, watching all

with an expression of amazement

and cries of fierce exaltation.

Title: Lonely, Like Me
Author: Thomas W. Case
As a child, the 80 acres seemed like the whole world, with its ponds and streams and sunlit meadows.
It looked like Eden to my young eyes.
I chased the lambs and dragonflies, caught tortoises and toads.
The banks of the streams looked like cliffs to me, as I watched the suspended shadows of the bluegill in the water below.

With July's on broil, I found shade beneath a black locust tree, and tried to figure out, how I could use the thorns as fish hooks, to catch dinner for the night.
Evening set the sky on fire and the clouds were all a blaze.
Passion found me early, so much land, and nothing but time.

Then dusk turned gently into night and the summer Moon looked sad, like a giant porch light left on, for a lover that's never coming home.
As I lay in bed the cicadas buzz tucked me in, and from the pond came to bullfrog sad song, and I knew he was lonely like me.

Title: you.
Author: aether ireniccx
what power you must have. 
to rip the selfishness out
from under my skin
with your bare finger nails
and melt the ice
protected in the center of my heart
like gold
protected in a guarded chamber. 
i didn’t know
how much of me was
missing
when i fell in love
with you. 
how did i get so lucky?
like god reached
her glorious hands down
created you
as the embodiment of
perfection. 
then you waltzed into my life
threw me into orbit
smiled at me
with that smile. 
and looked at me
with those eyes. 
made me fall
harder
farther
than i thought was possible. 

i mean
buy me a goddamn lottery ticket
because i surely must be
the
luckiest
person
alive. 
so forgive me
if i
stumble
and
fall
for i know not how
to love too well. 
i am clumsy
and my words
don’t form
as they should. 

so let me kiss you instead
and let my lips paint for you
all the pictures
that my clumsy heart
cannot.

if there comes a day
that i get to lay in bed
and it's our bed

and wait for you to come home
to our home

and have a shower
in our shower

if i woke up
and you were
laying beside me
your eyes closed
and your hair messy.
your breath
separating into silence
and your cold fingers
lacing themselves
with mine.
if i woke up tomorrow
and you belonged to me
would i
give you away?
or would i
make you
stay?

because i do not want to have you
to fill the empty parts of me.
i want to be full on my own
i want to be so complete
i could light a whole city and then
only then
would i want to have you.
because the two of us combined
could set it on fire. 
and i only hope
that you can handle
these flames.

Title: Nothing here lives, it seems
Author: Orange Sage
Behind this tumbled-down fence
of unassembled thoughts in half-buried bricks,
stack of rusty iron,
a footpath leads nowhere;

or perhaps there is heartbeat 
in the veins of these untamed trees,
in their half-dried branches,
some of them leaning towards earth.

Either side, houses with chimney smoke or children's chatter
translate verse into things alive;
overhead, rabbling of cockatoos hurry;
somewhere else. 

Beside a weed-choked plot circled in tomb-like rocks 
I ponder a consortium of cornstalks and vegetable stakes; 
an unfriendly breeze shivers through me, 
my thin cardigan;

perhaps I am an apparition
whispering across the future.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Morris Bridge
Author: Sammyfrommiami
Ruby frame rounding 
a weary winding path, 
sandy waves, a surfboard
to the stagnant sea of
yellow flies, mosquitos,
divots littered like mines,
as thick rubber tires
grit, skid against 
callous forest feet
meandering beside 
blistering summery heat,
a cool breeze defiant
as it conceals itself 
among the twitching trees.

Polished hands wearing,
throttled against each handle,
burning as bumblebees bump,
chase a fraud flowery hue;
once an effervescent path of
trickling cerulean creeks,
muddy ditches infested 
beastly boars roam 
the maze of detritus
of whose thirst echoes 
along thunderous thuds 
of an unfaltering ‘pecker; 
adrenaline coercing me
to the forest clearing.

Title: Shivering Sleeves of Autumn Breeze
Author: kaibab
First flurry drifts its windy feather,

yellow asking brown to dance 
in scattered lace,

gusting limb to offered hand,
across my meadow's golden stubble.

I have forgotten bone's, stoned chill,

when winter sends 
her frosty, two minute preview,

through quivering spill 
of worried sequence,

revealing aspen's leafy urge 
to purge fall's children,

late to school.

Title: Regifting Christmas Spirit
Author: Rachelegregs
the holidays approach
snow 
decorates
yards
houses
and driveways

icy flakes 
swirl through the air
coming gently to rest 

cars
mailboxes
and trees 
glisten with white sparkles

the fire is ablaze in the hearth
dad and I are wrapping gifts
throwing bits of brightly colored paper
into the fireplace
watching the flames shoot upward 
in unusual colors

giggling

presents are sparse 
our new home entitles us to a higher social status
not a more lucrative income
we decorate tokens of our love
to give joy to our family
paper featuring shiny trees, sleighs, santas
all red and green 
sealed with translucent tape
garnished with  ribbon

we are enjoying each other's company
too soon, the gift sat wrapped
peeking out from under the tree

dad picks up a vase on the coffee table
"I bet your mom would like this for christmas
I mean she liked it last christmas"
we snicker wrapping the vase in festive paper

I scan the room for other "gifts"
"how about this geode for keith?"
we wrapped the rock haphazzardly 
the sharper edges protrude
through paper's disguise

we continue collecting items around the room 
planning to present them as "gifts" to our family

the dog's  leash is even wrapped
to: craig
from:the dog 
the gift tag reads
she is sure to get a christmas morning walk

packages heap above the lower branches the tree on christmas morning
our family is stunned by the abundance 

piles of wrapping paper
send green and purple flames shooting up our chimney
tossed aside
as my mom and brothers 
rediscover the contents of our living room.

Title: Sea storm
Author: Robert Poleski
I've been a mariner 
the sea man
not sea-gazer in times of yore
sea is not a winding sheet of silver
for me stars do not 
fizz and shoot across the sky 

a bootlegger- 
stormy sea is the heaving salt coffin
made by the ark wright of the gods
I paid her a heavy ransom
in my years of life storms
she's been my friend-
my redemptor- 
'til my last 
most dreadful trip 

the storm was brewing--
the right time for the run
boat bucking and bobbing
rolling from side to side
like cork upon a capacious sea
keeled and tilted like
the death flop of a mackerel 
it's a strain to
keep it from being cloven asunder 
by white fangs of the vortex
and the sanded teeth of the reefs 

sea churned and boiled 
like cannibals cauldron
heaved and bulged
pushing up giant waves from 
the fathomless gullet of depths
wind screamed like banshee wail 
and whipped at my face

a mountainous wave rose up before me 
blotting out the sky
'the sails broke loose- yards flew round-
rope and shroud swung free' 
boat rose with the swell- inclining upwards 
then plummeted down into its milky depths
swallowed whole- then resurfaced-
rested on the reef
before going back down 

silence followed--
my two hands gripped the tiller refusing to let go
"A true mariner never desert's a sinking ship"--
--
mariners be damned 
I jumped

Title: Different Kinds of Beautiful
Author: Tod Howard Hawks
Different kinds of beautiful, black, brown,
red, yellow, deep blue eyes, slanted ones,
drums beating against a mountain side,
flutes floating through jungle vines, soft
prayers murmured on golden steppes,
mosques, cathedrals, churches on a country
hill, puppies, swallows, mountain lion
cubs, long, blonde hair, kinky curls, swirls
of laughter, tears of solace, tender drops
of rain upon her face, breezes blowing
sails homeward, silent moments between
passion and sunrise.

Title: Coronation
Author: Don Holland
Horse cavalry and marching bands
Matching pairs of greys, sixteen hands,
Priceless carriage of glistening gold
Bore the new monarch as of old.

Clergy in ancient vestiture.
Lords and Ladies in high couture
The combined choirs began to sing.
The Archbishop awaits the King.

His was not a young robust face,
that would take the beloved Queen's place.
Some had suggested in Charles stead,
William should be crowned as head.

They placed the crown upon his head,
we held our breath in awful dread.
Of what might happen should it fall
and a gasp should flood the packed hall.

Camilla, serene, in bridal white,
A statement about her earned right,
to be a vestal Queen consort
and equal mate in royal court.

Penny Mordaunt in Peacock blue
Looking classic and modern too,
her serene presence auguring,
for the jeweled sword of offering

A little over the top for their taste,
for those whom lower things embrace
The low and tawdry of current events,
taking down all offending monuments.

One more Icon to be destroyed
In a world that would be devoid
of any pretense to good will
in need of harmony's grace still.

There was a sense of de'ja' vu
As all dawns are beset with dew.
Hadn't we seen this all before,
Just prior, then after the war.

Kings had come and gone like flowers
Their time on Earth no more than ours.
And are we not freer than they 
ask Harry Windsor, "feet of clay."

Title: From Glacier to Shining Sea
Author: D.E. Navarro
I am a river
and I flow in wild courses
from glacial deposits
up in old Mount Tahoma
down steep ravines, 
through carved canyons, 
over rubble and into 
western red cedar copses.

I am an American bastard with
a Portuguese mother and unknown
Italian father. My older brother 
came from her first marriage to
an English esquire out of the
Tower of London Beefeaters.

My sister is a Korean war orphan 
found starving and eating bugs at
eighteen months old in a war torn
field where her parents' corpses 
lay vacant staring into space never
to see their daughter again.  

A Latino dad swooped in to 
take up our Portuguese-English-
Korean-Italian bastard family 
adding his own Mexican boy.
Dad lifted us out of poverty 
into American bourgeoisie, 
grade-makers and fierce 
competitors of the Joneses.

Alekhine was my boyhood hero
teaching me his famous chess 
defense, which I used against 
the haters who called us
gooks, spics, bastards
wetbacks, and PRs. I frothed
and foamed, splashing over
all the boulders and rocks.

I won and they hated me.  
No way could the bastard be 
the chess champ. I won at baseball, 
boy scouts, wargames, and academics.
Their hatred didn't matter because
I surged over the rubble 
and moved on.

Ten years I served in the Air Force
as a combat communicator and
war planner in multiple conflicts,
none as severe as my own upbringing.
I settled, grew a bit broader
and deeper.

Thirty years and my own family later
I still gush through valleys. I have
overflowed my banks and gathered
all as I roll, sucking in streams, creeks,
rivulets, and channels from marshes.
No one stops me and no one ever will
for I have the grandest of estuaries
to build and that still lies ahead. 

To that end I write paragraphs, poems, 
essays, and stories—words that whorl 
in eddies, the suspended fine granules 
that will fill the delta with rich loam 
as I pour forth into the sea.

Title: Funeral Blues
Author: W H Auden
Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.
Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'.
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.
He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.
The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;
For nothing now can ever come to any good.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: A Gathering Of Frogs
Author: Stewart Stafford
Through the fence with friends,
And into the back field frontier,
Past the growing pile of lumber,
Shivers for the Halloween bonfire.

Down the slope to a boundary hedge,
Rusty bathtub lying like a crime scene,
And into the deepening marsh beyond,
For the ritual kidnapping of frogspawn.

Frogs leap through reeds and tall grass,
The bulbous jelly of many eyes located,
Scooped surgically into a container,
Up to our fort to study our live plunder.

Tongues of smoke from our twig fire,
On the derelict path between estates,
Crisps consumed in the darkening chill,
Then, satiated, a walk home for dinner.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Stalker
Author: Firdaus Parvez
7 PM    the city never before felt
like it had teeth to bite your head off
your thigh
your breast

not until it happened to you
and not some newspaper
headline screaming a dead girl

now you clutch bravado in a fist
(little pink container of pepper spray)
as you walk from the deserted parking lot
to your apartment    thumb
fiddling with the child lock 
on-off-on-off    on

you wade through the visual field 
of an anonymous set of eyes
corroding the edges
of your independence

the hot breath of a breeze running
down your neck feels so male
you’re nervous that you’ll jump
the gun    blind an innocent
human with the face of a man

so you dial your mother
hundreds of miles away
she answers on one ring

how much further she asks
a hundred meters you say
okay she says    okay you echo

what’re you wearing she asks
you feel annoyance gather like
an angry mob on your tongue

don’t worry you tell her   I’m as grey
as the weather    all my blue
hair tucked into a ball cap
(bloody invisible)

she’s quiet for a moment
it’s never about that you know
–the clothes...    she trails off
you nod as if she can see you
how far now    about fifty
(it feels further)

you almost run the remaining distance
leaving behind a trail of half-breaths
and sound of your sneakers squelching
in the puddles like someone’s following

at the door you fumble with the key
then enter    double lock the door
yank the knob two times    then
once more    chain it   

I’m home you inform her
okay she breathes out
okay you repeat

for now

Title: The Old Steinway in a Forgotten Classroom
Author: Moshe18
Upon a time, I played
to awe filled, upturned faces
in reverent and hushed halls.
Grand theaters with gilded domes.
And I was the echo of the devine voice,
resonating in the high cathedral vaults.

It was my music that caused the congregation
to dance and speak in heavenly tongues
in that small, steaming, southern town.
And with a demon's howl and screech,
I shook those crowded, smoke filled clubs
that pulsate with sex under the ground.

So many musical reincarnations 
under the touch of countless hands.
The fine fingers of the refined artists
and the strong hands of the day labourers
who moonlight at honky-tonks and juke joints.
The unsure digits of the young and nervous novice.

Now I sit, chipped keys scratched and dusty
in a seldom used and unlit classroom;
broken hammers rattle, strings in need of tuning.
Now and again, on a happy and idle day,
the old janitor will take his lunch,
sit down on my bench and start playing.

Title: still life with cardinals
Author: ABlueSpeck
cool april rain fills a dinner plate birdbath 
a pair of mated cardinals couldn't be happier

the bright red male bounds towards her
they touch beaks 

during the cold winter he chased her away
from the sunflower seed dropped by black-capped chickadees
who sifted through my window feeder
in the bitter mornings

soon the wrens, never satisfied, would sift endlessly
casting their unquenchable disappointment to the ground
covering the deck in unwanted fruit

the day passes

very late, something scratches at the door
glimpses of small claws and a long tail 
retreats into the narrows of my foundation

the day arrives

Gymnopedie No.1 plays as the not quite gray sky
offers what it can to the nearly still greenery

intermittent sunlight forms shadows in between notes
painting dark branches on mottled trunks
then fading into muted uniformity

the feeder removed
leaving only the dinner plate thermae 

as dueling pairs of red cardinals bomb around the overgrowth
she bathes 
and wipes both sides of her orange bill
with an azalea branch 


sometime in April 2023

Title: Honoring Women
Author: Paul Thomas1
Married four times,
nineteen seventies
into the eighties.

Know two women today
as none before:
talk to them,
listen,
learn from
and about them.

In macho masculine years
exploitation the game,
no thought for friendship,
especially toward spouses,
goals already achieved.

Old habits die hard,
transparency requested
— my own and theirs.
I need to know if offending.
They need to know
they can tell me without
my often conflicting attitude
silencing their words. 

I honor women today
by encouraging them
to accept themselves and me
— as we are.

Title: April's Song .....
Author: Lulu Gee
I know a place beyond the frost
only a poet sees
where larks with lay trill all the day
from uncomplaining trees;
while echoes sound throughout the glen
to see the meadows crown'd
and sparrows twitter as they fly
above the mossy ground;
while rooster crows the break of dawn
in sunshine or in shade
the willow in her verdant gown
weeps wondrously array’d
beneath the tremblin’ blue of sky
o’er valleys pearl’d with dew
winter meadows stretch to green
now spring appears in view.

Title: San Sajir
Author: Peewee Cuson
in a serial matter of wonder bread
I wondered why bread and not cereal
oatmeal said hello and walked to
the desert where aboriginal camels 
were spitting out sunflower seeds and
they’d make King Midas feed the harpies
on the left side before low tides

he walked over to port side and looked 
into the street where gangly spiders 
and tryptophan were there with beef-
not turkey who I’ve heard was rather 
mundane but who knows aesthetics
better than Bill Cosby I’ve always
thought those sweaters were divine

and Jello made a lasting mold on the 
Middle East yet to come San Sajir had
heard whispers of a screaming elephant
who had in fact heard a who but who
no one knew who possibly Cindy Lou
but ideologically I doubt any gerrymandering 
was done because tutus are in season

Condolences on the sequestered contusion

Title: A Taste of Love
Author: Cassie Hughes
Candy floss kisses ‘neath carnival skies
Galloping horses, wild musical rides 
A bright golden prize swings in aqueous cage
The race of a heart in first loves heady stage

Musical laughter the fun of the fair
Diesel fumes acrid and warm on the air
Lost in the mirrors maze heart standing still
Lone and rejected the bitterest pill 

Umami tracks, clandestine in the dark
Racing away, music jangled and sharp
Bleeding and broken heart cast out to sea
Splash of the waves hiding unheeded plea

Acid drop memories of sideshow deceit
Misunderstood game with dishonest conceit
Rain drops blur the sky causing colours to blend
And the carnival closes, heart soured, the end.

Title: A Forest Recital
Author: Diane Hine
With V shaped brows benumbed in scowls
a pair of brindle mantled owls
sublime the moon with double vowels

hoo-hoo   hoo-hoo

The sublimated vapor trails
descend in curlicues and veils
to wrap and whet their cutlass nails

how far it flew

Platinum drips down cypress rungs
to infiltrate the swelling lungs
of denizens with many tongues

a night revue

One might expect a tin-snip shriek
emitted by a pincer beak
yet owls transcend the forest clique

a cuspate coup

Title: [ Mommy, your hair is white ]
Author: Hakan 7
Mama, your hair is white
What happens if you dye your hair like cotton?
Let the blue and yellow flutter on the horizons
forever mom

Mama, your hair is white
What happens if your eyes look blue again?
I think about yellow wheat fields

Mama, your hair is white
The end of the plain day is spring
blood lake land
a fallen homeland

Turkish Language Translation 

Annem saçların beyazlamış 

Annem saçlarin beyazlanmış 
Pamuk gibi boya saçlarını ne olur
Mavi sarı dalgalansın ufuklarda
Sonsuza kadar annem

Annem saçların beyazlanmış 
Gözlerin yine mavi mavi baksın ne olur
Sarı buğday tarlalarında dolanır aklıma

Annem saçların beyazlanmış 
Sade günün sonu bahar
kan gölü topraklara
düşmüş canım bir vatan

Title: War on many fronts
Author: Trevor P
One day we discovered a fragment of peace 
And angry it tried to intrude into our dark hollow lives 
We set it alight 
Content to wage a war
With no end in sight

Everyone is so dead set on being right 
And this urge is louder 
Than the: blood curdling screams for mercy; 
Howls of protest 
Dense echoes of tears 
Of your people 
Of my people 
Of our children.

We fight 
CRASH
Like glass on the floor 
Anger, like thunder 
Has struck all 
Of what we are
And now the only thing that stands 
Is our pride 

I fight 
Everyday
Every minute 
Every second
I fight my mutinous mind. 
A relentless bully 
who taunts and teases. 
It desperately 
Wants to anchor me to my knees 
Begging for mercy. 

Suddenly, I am under attack! 
Somehow, toxins stole inside 
Feeding, recuperating, making camp 
At my base so my furious army 
Prepare to chase these fools away. 

I fight. I know no other way.

Title: Dwindling Love Melts Ice
Author: Solus et Relictus
Behold, the ardor once ablaze, now grows dim,
Like crystalline hues that fade on a whim,
In sun's gentle touch, an alchemic embrace,
The essence diffuses, scarce a trace.

From the frigid citadel, a realm untamed,
Where frostbound fervor flickered unclaimed,
Now delicate cracks etch a fleeting design,
A dance of fragility, profound and fine.

Amidst the hushed whispers, a murmuring fade,
A melody dissolving, softly cascade,
As breathless whispers scarce remain,
Love's ebbing tide, a tender refrain.

No longer aglow with passion's bright gleam,
This frost-laden tale, a somber dream,
With words rare and scarce, its essence conveyed,
In dwindling love, where truths find their way.

Bangladesh is land of the monsoon rain,
mighty rivers, dikes, and flood plains.

Blend of myriad of colors and shades,
prose and poetry, submitters and saints.

It was the melting pot where races had mixed
and cultures converged to make into monolith.

It is the place where the greeting is friendly,
kins are plenty and the mate ships are anew,
where hopes are high and needs are a few,
and they do or die but say not in adieu.

It is the land of Tagore, Nazrul, Jibanandadash,
Jasimuddin, Rokeya, Titumir, Mujibur, Bashani,
Bowl, Bose, Yunus, Ziaur, Chandra, Jalal, Hyder,
shanty dwellers, innovators, gossipers, hawkers,
landless farmers, CNGs and the rickshaw pullers.

It is the place where nature repeatedly gives and takes,
and millions constantly struggle to sustain and make.

Dhaka the capital city is renowned for mosques 
and pollution, lavish wedding receptions and 
ubiquitous traffic jams.

Now that the land is infested with corruption,
hurdles after hurdles, bureaucracy and violence,
some despair and profess that it is beyond repair.
As others continue to toil in goodness of the man.

Behold!
The idea of inherent inferiority of a race or 
endowed supremacy of another is neither 
tenable nor can it be sustained.

As it contradicts with the Creator’s Plan
expressed in the law of natural selection!

Title: Hopeless Love
Author: Arch Hay
She stands in the doorway thinking of her unrequited love.
Heartache made visible in her unblinking eyes.
Bleached blonde hair unkempt, she ties it in a bun, 
The unspoken truth of a sorrowful life undone. 

Transparent as a pane of glass, she is emotion. 
Hope for love that never comes, unfulfilled and spent. 
Held captive by devotion to an unyielding heart 
Abandoned and alone, unable her love to impart. 

She finds solace watching those passing by. 
Lovers hand-in-hand with no thought of goodbye. 
Days filled with longing for what could have been 
For a love that will never come again. 

She searches for a way out from this bottomless well, 
Trapped and ensnared in an unrequited spell. 
Pain is the only thing left to feel when dreams turn to dust. 
The ache of a thousand broken promises built on false trust. 

The weight of it pushing down harder each day, 
Until there's nothing but darkness where joy used to stay.
Thoughts of him echoing through her mind like a dirge. 
Memories of shared moments with darkness merge. 

Her longing's so deep it brings physical pain 
As she curses the love that drove her insane. 
She looks towards the sky seeking an answer divine 
But none appears as she watches the stars for a sign.

Each night before slumber takes hold, her pillow's soaked with tears,
As she remembers his smile, his laughter and their shared years. 
Awake all moonlit night, 
Her unrequited love 
Haunting her until morning light.

Title: If Only I Could Disappear
Author: Todd Wooten
Carpet burns from the closet floor
bombarding icy draft from darkened vents
mom’s high heels a protective moat
I tremble deep within my makeshift fortress
guarded by pillows and family quilts

Cracked light streams through the crevices 
in despair I look towards the hinges and lock
my mind like a General rousing his troops,
shouting “Hold! Hold!” to my wooden shield
an inch and three quarter layer of protection

Voices approach with tiptoeing echoes 
a thud of knuckles, a twisting of knob
in the ninety degree angle 
there’s no further retreat

Clothes tussle my hair from dull plastic hangers
as I rise to my toes, through shuddering sobs
fist tighten, eyes widen 
through explosive heartbeats

Title: Woolly Thinking
Author: John Curtis
Look lady, you
won't need those balls,
you'll be so hot
outside these walls.

your knitting is
a waste of time,
your blanket won't
be worth a dime.

Our world was once
a purl in space,
but now it's quite
a plain old place.

The wool's been pulled
over our eyes
as inch by inch
this planet dies.

A thread was snagged
some time ago;
unravelling
at first so slow.

Now we have heard
the Final Trump
and that's a real
kick in the rump.

Woolgathering 
as years go by,
he wooed the Reps
with rough four-ply.

We have been sold
a rotten yarn,
that ozone hole's
too large to darn.

So knit up the
ravelled sleeve of care
and weep for the
last polar bear.

Title: Think not with these two arms I reach the blue
Author: PeregrineBoston
Think not with these two arms I reach the blue, 
But with mine eye may I the heavens see -- 
With the latter then contrive a view
To practice private ornithomancy.

The swallow-tailed kite may tell one much of
The hawkish lore, the hunt and war; the tern
Tells thee the secrets of the sea. A dove
Will trill of peace, of love, as one can learn.

And zebra finches shock the azure climes
Outrageous as Rimbaud, Icarian
While ravens flock in ordinary time
Augustly as do seminarians.

Title: Rose Roof Roll
Author: EdnaModeNumber1Fangirl
Say, go to the morning,
indifferent to the going
gorge on fluorescent cream 
and inside snoring hours dream:

Ah, say

Crammed gorgeous in fabric
taught like canvas or
thin-straying tension 
which fosters open
swinging hinge door lips.

Truffle tree puffball paste,
warm and massive mounds.
I can pick a million pink dandelions 
and sink to the bottom. 
Ombre jelly bounce.

Sunset spectators roll off rooftops
and giggle as they fall, 
a gust of passion blows 
so sadly 
as to plummet, 
and now I know you're lost.

We articulate little 
our hems catch on 
and on parental normalcies
as the lyre on a callous 
till I choke splutter scream and 
awake.

By rustling to the cool pocket
I have mustered another minute in 
my dream
before it snaps to varnish.
There's roseate xylem 
oozing from the canopy
plump, fruiting, delicate, and spiked. 

I'll rummage in the pink piles
somewhere a hand,
not a minute now
gagging and grasping 
flounders at the brink.

Sun's up now to choose 
the peony place and his
asthmatic hand
or 
the jovial eruption breaching 
Earth's routinely skies.

Title: Washing line blues
Author: Linbar19
Wind winding wending - snapping, snaggling 
granddaughters satin minuscule underwear
hung beside my baggy cotton stretched elastic 
bloomers lolling limp, sagging from the cloths line.

The breeze bemused by pegged tweenie bra
a gust of wind tethers my underwear to a spiked
green plant named Mother in laws Tongue.

Next wash day, my new black silken fitted tummy trimmer knickers
Nana appropriate, are pegged dancing a sedate Rhumba beside
the teenage tango.

Title: sky sailing
Author: Andrew Taranta
the sun has your hair 
your cheeks were 
pressed against a rose 
a bunny slope
and a waterfall of snow
a hot air balloon 
flys through your eyes
and all those spotted freckles
make shapes in mine

Title: High spirits
Author: Pauljonathanco
Desires of the air, dreaming sun.
Only fools keep breathing.
Messengers hide their endless gifts.
Serene lands, lyres and pipes play on.
Truth is out, dryads feasting in high spirits.
Mortals don't know what deities.

Title: Night of the Scorpion
Author: Nissim Ezekiel
I remember the night my mother
was stung by a scorpion. Ten hours
of steady rain had driven him
to crawl beneath a sack of rice.
Parting with his poison - flash
of diabolic tail in the dark room -
he risked the rain again.
The peasants came like swarms of flies
and buzzed the name of God a hundred times
to paralyse the Evil One.
With candles and with lanterns
throwing giant scorpion shadows
on the mud-baked walls
they searched for him: he was not found.
They clicked their tongues.
With every movement that the scorpion made his poison moved in Mother's blood, they said.
May he sit still, they said
May the sins of your previous birth
be burned away tonight, they said.
May your suffering decrease
the misfortunes of your next birth, they said.
May the sum of all evil
balanced in this unreal world
against the sum of good
become diminished by your pain.
May the poison purify your flesh
of desire, and your spirit of ambition,
they said, and they sat around
on the floor with my mother in the centre,
the peace of understanding on each face.
More candles, more lanterns, more neighbours,
more insects, and the endless rain.
My mother twisted through and through,
groaning on a mat.
My father, sceptic, rationalist,
trying every curse and blessing,
powder, mixture, herb and hybrid.
He even poured a little paraffin
upon the bitten toe and put a match to it.
I watched the flame feeding on my mother.
I watched the holy man perform his rites to tame the poison with an incantation.
After twenty hours
it lost its sting.
My mother only said
Thank God the scorpion picked on me
And spared my children.

Certain days arrive and leave like
the meter reader who stops
just long enough to record 
your numbers, over and over 
house after house; then poof
you’re history.  Later, you receive
and pay the bill.  Next month

he briefly notes 
you exist; records 
numbers and forgets
your reality.  If you leave,
the wheels stop turning and
he records the same number
month after month, until

one day they yank 
your meter from its mount …
millions of meters record
all zeros.  With replacements,
wheels once again begin their
turn.  The meter-reader stops
just long enough to record

new numbers, then walks
away.  It seems that when one
dies, the elusive they record one’s
numbers; keep the clock
ticking, without, for even a moment
covering its face.  And we wave
our flags, bow our heads 

and for sixty seconds regard
those mega-million lives snatched 
away, so that we can choose apartment 
or house; Ace or Lowes; McDonald’s or
Subway; Jesus or Yahweh, Allah
Buddha, Hindu, Shinto
something or nothing at all.

Title: Salem XIII
Author: Hannah Hawthorne
The birth of Salem,
In 1626
Derived from the Hebrew word,
from peace 
Ironic, 
might I add
Salem 1

In 1628,
Massachusetts Bay,
settles down and makes a home
A fleet of English puritans,
John Winthrop taking lead 
Salem 2

A year following,
autonomy is granted
By the English monarch no less,
but what would you expect?
For you know what proceeds
Salem 3

As the days are longer,
and the sun is hot,
a church emerges
Built from the not yet tainted land
Salem 4

The winter has passed,
and the charter is in danger,
Defences are prepared,
people gather as Endicott,
cuts a cross from an English flag
Salem 5

The years begin to gather,
as we reach 1637
Ships set sail to the West Indies,
trading salted cod
Salem 6

Soldiers assemble,
And the troops begin to mobilise
And birthed from this pack of men,
comes the modern national guard 
Salem 7

Time has passed,
since the ships arrived,
and people have grown older
From greying hair and small wrinkles,
to they decaying flesh of others.
Old burying point is built
Salem 8

A fort is built,
upon the rocks of winter island
Built in 1643,
named after king William 
Salem 9

Many years have passed,
now it’s 1668
A wealthy merchants house is built,
the house of seven gables
Salem 10

We come towards the present,
in 1686,
20 pound cannot by time,
But it can certainly buy land
Salem 11

Our tale reaches its peak,
in 1692
Girls begin to have seizures,
deemed more devil like than medical
Betty and Abigail,
Ann and Elizabeth,
were the first four to accuse

Goodbye to Sarah Good and Osborne
Goodbye to Tituba,
Hung around February 
The Destitute,
the Faithless,
and the Slave

Goodbye Martha Corey,
Goodbye young Dorothy,
Goodbye Rebecca Nurse and Rachel Clinton,
hung in cool march
A skeptic and a child,
Some churchgoers too
Salem 12

Salem 1760,
and the courthouse is torn down
It’s broken walls meet,
the now tainted soil
Salem 13

Why must we be so naïve,
So cruel and so unfair,
Salem witches were just women,
that’s all there is to declare,

Goodbye to both Sarahs 
To Tituba
To Martha and to Dorothy
To Rebecca and to Rachel 

Goodbye the women who shaped a part of history
To the women,
not the witches

Title: Hingeless, Unable to Swing
Author: Balldinger
Where are the sterling teeth 
nibbling at the tender flesh 
of lovers beneath separated 
moons of gold and blackened 
hills running paceless over 
universal graves of contentment? 

Where are the swift electricities? 
Where are the currents jolting 
songs to life and words leaping 
off pages into our hearts to go 
if all the holstered doors become 
hingeless - unable to swing?

Where are the vaunted peaks? 
Clinging to rise in rambled 
peril dislodged – fraught 
with transitory themes aligned? 
Where are the time-extorted 
pockets grown for crystals clear? 

Awake the sleeping aquifer – 
labyrinth-bearing stack pearl – 
storgē language fed to rites 
ranked in piles driven coral high. 
Where are the open windows – 
hingeless – unable to swing?
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Sick
Author: Michael Tilbury
the constant coughing, dead bodies
piling up outside beneath the window
from wars and greed
sedans slumped with corpses
mottled green on eggplant purple

the dustiness of the hellscapes I lived with
Afghanistan, Texas

break break

silver beard and a shotgun
baby blue and a rusted truck

invading my mind
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: What I do to control my anger
Author: Horsa
When I'm angry, singing, song-writing & poetry are my best friends.
I vent in rhyme or sing until my anger ends.
A crescendo is a good song to sing when I'm mad.
It mimics the way we express anger vocally without repercussions which are bad.
It starts off quiet & gets louder until it reaches a climax.
It's better than arguing with an old battle axe.
Singing a medley of songs which start quiet then get loud is another idea.
As these ways of venting aren't confrontational you can use them without fear.
They're better than getting violent or arguing the toss.
Violence & arguments always leave you at a loss.
Sometimes I just go for a walk.
Then when I'm calm I sit down & talk.
We solve the problems we couldn't when we were mad.
Problems solved calmly don't turn out as bad.
I hope this helps someone out.
Remember, you don't have to scream & shout.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: On My Way to the Picnic With Matilde
Author: Lonna Lewis Blodgett
Four legs quiver
like clumsy cabrioles
striking smooth gray rivers
of zig-zag sidewalk barrios
in rhythm with happy shivers
syncopated on a muffled drum
as we talk and stroll 

On our way
hand-in-hand 
we persuade and pretend 
this day away
taunting and cajoling to demand
laughing “hide and seeking”
chasing and skedaddling
poking and peeking
like cuddly pandas
or canoodling otters
splashing and clambering

We roll and meander
impetuously twiddling all the way 
atop gregarious green promenades 
we pause in slight delay 
as we prattle and prance
as we dance to the Crickets singing
nodding to their fiddling
frolicking with all the jiggling

Serendipitous stalks 
of snickering flowers pop
to dazzle and razzle our wits
we glide in stripes of candy bits 
of rainbows bright

Purple painted paisley
fragrantly flairs in pairs 
of scented lavender sweetness
among black-eyed daisies
dusting the woozy air
in a meadow’s billowing bloom
sunflowers sunbathe in costume 

We giddily tarry 
as we carry 
a feast of fancies and treats
artsy bits of charmed delicacies
filled with a peck of upcoming kisses
enticing fantasies that wink 

Snuggling shenanigans lead us astray
as we find our rootie-tootie hideaway 
hugs as we shy away
from tomfoolery jesting
to lay down and swoon
looking up at the soon to be stars
lingering for the coming of the moon

Murmurs of Starlings
gaggle their harmonies
of chirps
in cheeks and broadened beaks
thrumming tiny melodies.

Swallows sweep and woo
fixated on this unabashed swain 
through songbird strains
announcing a shrilling review
broadening in sweet refrains

“I love you…I love you”

Fingerpainting the Monet sky
puffy white cotton words appear
from clouds passing by
while tiny violins spin in the air 
piccolos peep 
pigeon-toed Doves coo and weep
their contentedness to appease
trailing off the pleasant breeze

I fall upon my knees

My words explode to strew
like a thousand storms set free

“I love you…I love you…I love you”
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Bother, Smother
Author: PhoenixRisingSun
gloss over posting
salute sing and bother
fought singed and ghost
pilgrimage silent daughter
passage feint and slaughter

toss the coin double sided
crickets molding echoes
shallow pool and gene stool
bothering, smothering
life and decay bellows
smoldering granite salt
gold sold and halt
Tell me? When does it start?
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Who Needs Princes?
Author: David Welch
Shannon watched a royal wedding
one afternoon on the TV,
the flowers, coaches, and garlands,
all the pomp and majesty,
the fancy gowns and ornate hats,
black-tie suits that fit handsomely,
noble steeds pulling carriages,
in her minds arose fantasies…

She saw herself in a ballroom
twirling ’round her paramour,
taking the hand of her suave prince,
in the arch of a gothic door,
cruising the warm Riviera
in a yacht that would leave most floored,
closets full of lovely dresses,
rows of the fanciest shoes galore.

She dreamed of sprawling palaces,
of servant to see to her whims,
four-poster bed, with chandelier,
to lie down and make love to him,
a gilded, bulging treasury,
gold and silver and jewels within;
all girls want to be princesses,
the thought of it still made her grin.

But then she recalled another
prince who had gone on a talk show,
airing all the dirty laundry,
sought to lay his family low,
and another caught cheating with
a stewardess while on the go,
the tabloids found out, ran wild,
until folks were all in the know.

She recalled the older prince who
folks said was a pedophile,
and how it all had been hushed up,
elites don’t like to stand trial,
and she saw how they lived planned lives,
schedules just weren’t her style,
and travelling without her kids,
not seeing them for long whiles?

It make her look out to the den,
on the couch slept her husband, Stan,
in his arms snoozed little Carmen;
as a father, none were more grand,
he worked, he sweat, he came off rough,
but always by her did he stand,
what need had Shannon of princes
when she’d landed herself a man.

Title: Lone bloom
Author: Bluewrite76
twilights a few ago 
sturdy farmer planted them seeds 
singing to the glory of the sun
gutsy voice carried along winds 
along came a tiny seed 
fell upon the curled leaf 
ferried to the wooded moor
orphaned from its golden ley 

yet tiny brave doll 
rose up in sugary optimism
head high among alien roots 
looking towards the sun 
eclipsed by wood giants 
he did his blessed part 
fed the hard worker bee 
baked his green kitchen breads
stocked up his seed larder 

waits on the lonely line 
for soft explorer palms 
to pick him up 
for his treasured resources 
or cradle him inside 
a book or potpuri 
until his communion with nature
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: History Of The Night
Author: Jorge Luis Borges
Throughout the course of the generations
men constructed the night.
At first she was blindness; 
thorns raking bare feet,
fear of wolves.
We shall never know who forged the word
for the interval of shadow 
dividing the two twilights;
we shall never know in what age it came to mean
the starry hours.
Others created the myth.
They made her the mother of the unruffled Fates
that spin our destiny,
they sacrificed black ewes to her, and the cock
who crows his own death. 
The Chaldeans assigned to her twelve houses;
to Zeno, infinite words.
She took shape from Latin hexameters
and the terror of Pascal.
Luis de Leon saw in her the homeland
of his stricken soul.
Now we feel her to be inexhaustible
like an ancient wine
and no one can gaze on her without vertigo
and time has charged her with eternity.


And to think that she wouldn't exist 
except for those fragile instruments, the eyes.

Title: San Sajir
Author: Peewee Cuson
in a serial matter of wonder bread
I wondered why bread and not cereal
oatmeal said hello and walked to
the desert where aboriginal camels 
were spitting out sunflower seeds and
they’d make King Midas feed the harpies
on the left side before low tides

he walked over to port side and looked 
into the street where gangly spiders 
and tryptophan were there with beef-
not turkey who I’ve heard was rather 
mundane but who knows aesthetics
better than Bill Cosby I’ve always
thought those sweaters were divine

and Jello made a lasting mold on the 
Middle East yet to come San Sajir had
heard whispers of a screaming elephant
who had in fact heard a who but who
no one knew who possibly Cindy Lou
but ideologically I doubt any gerrymandering 
was done because tutus are in season

Condolences on the sequestered contusion

Title: A Taste of Love
Author: Cassie Hughes
Candy floss kisses ‘neath carnival skies
Galloping horses, wild musical rides 
A bright golden prize swings in aqueous cage
The race of a heart in first loves heady stage

Musical laughter the fun of the fair
Diesel fumes acrid and warm on the air
Lost in the mirrors maze heart standing still
Lone and rejected the bitterest pill 

Umami tracks, clandestine in the dark
Racing away, music jangled and sharp
Bleeding and broken heart cast out to sea
Splash of the waves hiding unheeded plea

Acid drop memories of sideshow deceit
Misunderstood game with dishonest conceit
Rain drops blur the sky causing colours to blend
And the carnival closes, heart soured, the end.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: A Forest Recital
Author: Diane Hine
With V shaped brows benumbed in scowls
a pair of brindle mantled owls
sublime the moon with double vowels

hoo-hoo   hoo-hoo

The sublimated vapor trails
descend in curlicues and veils
to wrap and whet their cutlass nails

how far it flew

Platinum drips down cypress rungs
to infiltrate the swelling lungs
of denizens with many tongues

a night revue

One might expect a tin-snip shriek
emitted by a pincer beak
yet owls transcend the forest clique

a cuspate coup

Title: [ Mommy, your hair is white ]
Author: Hakan 7
Mama, your hair is white
What happens if you dye your hair like cotton?
Let the blue and yellow flutter on the horizons
forever mom

Mama, your hair is white
What happens if your eyes look blue again?
I think about yellow wheat fields

Mama, your hair is white
The end of the plain day is spring
blood lake land
a fallen homeland

Turkish Language Translation 

Annem saçların beyazlamış 

Annem saçlarin beyazlanmış 
Pamuk gibi boya saçlarını ne olur
Mavi sarı dalgalansın ufuklarda
Sonsuza kadar annem

Annem saçların beyazlanmış 
Gözlerin yine mavi mavi baksın ne olur
Sarı buğday tarlalarında dolanır aklıma

Annem saçların beyazlanmış 
Sade günün sonu bahar
kan gölü topraklara
düşmüş canım bir vatan

Title: War on many fronts
Author: Trevor P
One day we discovered a fragment of peace 
And angry it tried to intrude into our dark hollow lives 
We set it alight 
Content to wage a war
With no end in sight

Everyone is so dead set on being right 
And this urge is louder 
Than the: blood curdling screams for mercy; 
Howls of protest 
Dense echoes of tears 
Of your people 
Of my people 
Of our children.

We fight 
CRASH
Like glass on the floor 
Anger, like thunder 
Has struck all 
Of what we are
And now the only thing that stands 
Is our pride 

I fight 
Everyday
Every minute 
Every second
I fight my mutinous mind. 
A relentless bully 
who taunts and teases. 
It desperately 
Wants to anchor me to my knees 
Begging for mercy. 

Suddenly, I am under attack! 
Somehow, toxins stole inside 
Feeding, recuperating, making camp 
At my base so my furious army 
Prepare to chase these fools away. 

I fight. I know no other way.

Title: Dwindling Love Melts Ice
Author: Solus et Relictus
Behold, the ardor once ablaze, now grows dim,
Like crystalline hues that fade on a whim,
In sun's gentle touch, an alchemic embrace,
The essence diffuses, scarce a trace.

From the frigid citadel, a realm untamed,
Where frostbound fervor flickered unclaimed,
Now delicate cracks etch a fleeting design,
A dance of fragility, profound and fine.

Amidst the hushed whispers, a murmuring fade,
A melody dissolving, softly cascade,
As breathless whispers scarce remain,
Love's ebbing tide, a tender refrain.

No longer aglow with passion's bright gleam,
This frost-laden tale, a somber dream,
With words rare and scarce, its essence conveyed,
In dwindling love, where truths find their way.

Title: miss violet’s tears
Author: Karina.x
miss violet turns 
pale blue when
mr winter cruises by

grey shaded evening 
puffs heavy clouds
bursting water sprinkles 

splish splosh splatter
they collide with her eyes 
own raindrops 

pruny thin fingers tap 
tap 
tap 
on weeping glass 

swollen cold tears spread 
through lacy white patterns 
smeared all over the window 

weaving in between twisted
branches on hunched trees 
the race is on to see which 
tears hit the snowy floor first

Title: Bangladesh
Author: Jujube
Bangladesh is the land of monsoon rain,
mighty rivers, dikes, and flood plains.
The blend of myriad of colors and shades,
prose and poetry, submitters and saints.
It was the melting pot where races had mixed
and the cultures converged to make into monolith.
It is the place where the greeting is friendly,
kins are plenty and the mateship’s anew,
where hopes are high and needs’re a few,
and they do or die but say not in adieu.
It is the land of Tagore, Nazrul, Jibanandadash,
Jasimuddin, Rokeya, Titumir, Mujibur, Vashani,
Bowl, Bose, Yunus, Ziaur, Chandra, Jalal, Hyder,
shanty dwellers, innovators, gossipers, hawkers,
landless farmers, CNGs and the rickshaw pullers!
It is the place where nature repeatedly gives and takes,
and millions constantly struggle to sustain and make.
The mighty city is renowned for mosques and pollution,
lavish wedding receptions and the ubiquitous traffic jam!

Now that the land is infested with corruption,
hurdles after hurdles, bureaucracy and violence,
some despair and profess that it is beyond repair,
As others continue to toil in goodness of the man.

Behold!
The idea of inherent inferiority of a race
or the endowed supremacy of another,
is neither tenable nor can it be sustained.
As it contradicts with the Creator’s Plan
expressed in the law of natural selection!

Title: Hopeless Love
Author: Arch Hay
She stands in the doorway thinking of her unrequited love.
Heartache made visible in her unblinking eyes.
Bleached blonde hair unkempt, she ties it in a bun, 
The unspoken truth of a sorrowful life undone. 

Transparent as a pane of glass, she is emotion. 
Hope for love that never comes, unfulfilled and spent. 
Held captive by devotion to an unyielding heart 
Abandoned and alone, unable her love to impart. 

She finds solace watching those passing by. 
Lovers hand-in-hand with no thought of goodbye. 
Days filled with longing for what could have been 
For a love that will never come again. 

She searches for a way out from this bottomless well, 
Trapped and ensnared in an unrequited spell. 
Pain is the only thing left to feel when dreams turn to dust. 
The ache of a thousand broken promises built on false trust. 

The weight of it pushing down harder each day, 
Until there's nothing but darkness where joy used to stay.
Thoughts of him echoing through her mind like a dirge. 
Memories of shared moments with darkness merge. 

Her longing's so deep it brings physical pain 
As she curses the love that drove her insane. 
She looks towards the sky seeking an answer divine 
But none appears as she watches the stars for a sign.

Each night before slumber takes hold, her pillow's soaked with tears,
As she remembers his smile, his laughter and their shared years. 
Awake all moonlit night, 
Her unrequited love 
Haunting her until morning light.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: If Only I Could Disappear
Author: Todd Wooten
Carpet burns from the closet floor
bombarding icy draft from darkened vents
mom’s high heels a protective moat
I tremble deep within my makeshift fortress
guarded by pillows and family quilts

Cracked light streams through the crevices 
in despair I look towards the hinges and lock
my mind like a General rousing his troops,
shouting “Hold! Hold!” to my wooden shield
an inch and three quarter layer of protection

Voices approach with tiptoeing echoes 
a thud of knuckles, a twisting of knob
in the ninety degree angle 
there’s no further retreat

Clothes tussle my hair from dull plastic hangers
as I rise to my toes, through shuddering sobs
fist tighten, eyes widen 
through explosive heartbeats
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Woolly Thinking
Author: John Curtis
Look lady, you
won't need those balls,
you'll be so hot
outside these walls.

your knitting is
a waste of time,
your blanket won't
be worth a dime.

Our world was once
a purl in space,
but now it's quite
a plain old place.

The wool's been pulled
over our eyes
as inch by inch
this planet dies.

A thread was snagged
some time ago;
unravelling
at first so slow.

Now we have heard
the Final Trump
and that's a real
kick in the rump.

Woolgathering 
as years go by,
he wooed the Reps
with rough four-ply.

We have been sold
a rotten yarn,
that ozone hole's
too large to darn.

So knit up the
ravelled sleeve of care
and weep for the
last polar bear.

Title: Think not with these two arms I reach the blue
Author: PeregrineBoston
Think not with these two arms I reach the blue, 
But with mine eye may I the heavens see -- 
With the latter then contrive a view
To practice private ornithomancy.

The swallow-tailed kite may tell one much of
The hawkish lore, the hunt and war; the tern
Tells thee the secrets of the sea. A dove
Will trill of peace, of love, as one can learn.

And zebra finches shock the azure climes
Outrageous as Rimbaud, Icarian
While ravens flock in ordinary time
Augustly as do seminarians.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Did I Not Say To You
Author: Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi
Did I not say to you, “Go not there, for I am your friend; in this
mirage of annihilation I am the fountain of life?”
Even though in anger you depart a hundred thousand years
from me, in the end you will come to me, for I am your goal.
Did I not say to you, “Be not content with worldly forms, for I
am the fashioner of the tabernacle of your contentment?”
Did I not say to you, “I am the sea and you are a single fish;
go not to dry land, for I am your crystal sea?”
Did I not say to you, “ Go not like birds to the snare; come, for
I am the power of flight and your wings and feet?”
Did I not say to you, “ They will waylay you and make you
cold, for I am the fire and warmth and heat of your desire?”
Did I not say to you, “ They will implant in you ugly qualities
so that you will forget that I am the source of purity to you?”
Did I not say to you, “Do not say from what direction the ser-
vant’s affairs come into order?” I am the Creator without
directions.
If you are the lamp of the heart, know where the road is to the
house; and if you are godlike of attribute, know that I am your
Master.

Title: Rose Roof Roll
Author: EdnaModeNumber1Fangirl
Say, go to the morning,
indifferent to the going
gorge on fluorescent cream 
and inside snoring hours dream:

Ah, say

Crammed gorgeous in fabric
taught like canvas or
thin-straying tension 
which fosters open
swinging hinge door lips.

Truffle tree puffball paste,
warm and massive mounds.
I can pick a million pink dandelions 
and sink to the bottom. 
Ombre jelly bounce.

Sunset spectators roll off rooftops
and giggle as they fall, 
a gust of passion blows 
so sadly 
as to plummet, 
and now I know you're lost.

We articulate little 
our hems catch on 
and on parental normalcies
as the lyre on a callous 
till I choke splutter scream and 
awake.

By rustling to the cool pocket
I have mustered another minute in 
my dream
before it snaps to varnish.
There's roseate xylem 
oozing from the canopy
plump, fruiting, delicate, and spiked. 

I'll rummage in the pink piles
somewhere a hand,
not a minute now
gagging and grasping 
flounders at the brink.

Sun's up now to choose 
the peony place and his
asthmatic hand
or 
the jovial eruption breaching 
Earth's routinely skies.

Title: Washing line blues
Author: Linbar19
Wind winding wending - snapping, snaggling 
granddaughters satin minuscule underwear
hung beside my baggy cotton stretched elastic 
bloomers lolling limp, sagging from the cloths line.

The breeze bemused by pegged tweenie bra
a gust of wind tethers my underwear to a spiked
green plant named Mother in laws Tongue.

Next wash day, my new black silken fitted tummy trimmer knickers
Nana appropriate, are pegged dancing a sedate Rhumba beside
the teenage tango.

Title: sky sailing
Author: Andrew Taranta
the sun has your hair 
your cheeks were 
pressed against a rose 
a bunny slope
and a waterfall of snow
a hot air balloon 
flys through your eyes
and all those spotted freckles
make shapes in mine

Title: High spirits
Author: Pauljonathanco
Desires of the air, dreaming sun.
Only fools keep breathing.
Messengers hide their endless gifts.
Serene lands, lyres and pipes play on.
Truth is out, dryads feasting in high spirits.
Mortals don't know what deities.

Certain days arrive and leave like
the meter reader who stops
just long enough to record 
your numbers, over and over 
house after house; then poof
you’re history.  Later, you receive
and pay the bill.  Next month

he briefly notes 
you exist; records 
numbers and forgets
your reality.  If you leave,
the wheels stop turning and
he records the same number
month after month, until

one day they yank 
your meter from its mount …
millions of meters record
all zeros.  With replacements,
wheels once again begin their
turn.  The meter-reader stops
just long enough to record

new numbers, then walks
away.  It seems that when one
dies, the elusive they record one’s
numbers; keep the clock
ticking, without, for even a moment
covering its face.  And we wave
our flags, bow our heads 

and for sixty seconds regard
those mega-million lives snatched 
away, so that we can choose apartment 
or house; Ace or Lowes; McDonald’s or
Subway; Jesus or Yahweh, Allah
Buddha, Hindu, Shinto
something or nothing at all.

Title: Salem XIII
Author: Hannah Hawthorne
The birth of Salem,
In 1626
Derived from the Hebrew word,
from peace 
Ironic, 
might I add
Salem 1

In 1628,
Massachusetts Bay,
settles down and makes a home
A fleet of English puritans,
John Winthrop taking lead 
Salem 2

A year following,
autonomy is granted
By the English monarch no less,
but what would you expect?
For you know what proceeds
Salem 3

As the days are longer,
and the sun is hot,
a church emerges
Built from the not yet tainted land
Salem 4

The winter has passed,
and the charter is in danger,
Defences are prepared,
people gather as Endicott,
cuts a cross from an English flag
Salem 5

The years begin to gather,
as we reach 1637
Ships set sail to the West Indies,
trading salted cod
Salem 6

Soldiers assemble,
And the troops begin to mobilise
And birthed from this pack of men,
comes the modern national guard 
Salem 7

Time has passed,
since the ships arrived,
and people have grown older
From greying hair and small wrinkles,
to they decaying flesh of others.
Old burying point is built
Salem 8

A fort is built,
upon the rocks of winter island
Built in 1643,
named after king William 
Salem 9

Many years have passed,
now it’s 1668
A wealthy merchants house is built,
the house of seven gables
Salem 10

We come towards the present,
in 1686,
20 pound cannot by time,
But it can certainly buy land
Salem 11

Our tale reaches its peak,
in 1692
Girls begin to have seizures,
deemed more devil like than medical
Betty and Abigail,
Ann and Elizabeth,
were the first four to accuse

Goodbye to Sarah Good and Osborne
Goodbye to Tituba,
Hung around February 
The Destitute,
the Faithless,
and the Slave

Goodbye Martha Corey,
Goodbye young Dorothy,
Goodbye Rebecca Nurse and Rachel Clinton,
hung in cool march
A skeptic and a child,
Some churchgoers too
Salem 12

Salem 1760,
and the courthouse is torn down
It’s broken walls meet,
the now tainted soil
Salem 13

Why must we be so naïve,
So cruel and so unfair,
Salem witches were just women,
that’s all there is to declare,

Goodbye to both Sarahs 
To Tituba
To Martha and to Dorothy
To Rebecca and to Rachel 

Goodbye the women who shaped a part of history
To the women,
not the witches

Title: Hingeless, Unable to Swing
Author: Balldinger
Where are the sterling teeth 
nibbling at the tender flesh 
of lovers beneath separated 
moons of gold and blackened 
hills running paceless over 
universal graves of contentment? 

Where are the swift electricities? 
Where are the currents jolting 
songs to life and words leaping 
off pages into our hearts to go 
if all the holstered doors become 
hingeless - unable to swing?

Where are the vaunted peaks? 
Clinging to rise in rambled 
peril dislodged – fraught 
with transitory themes aligned? 
Where are the time-extorted 
pockets grown for crystals clear? 

Awake the sleeping aquifer – 
labyrinth-bearing stack pearl – 
storgē language fed to rites 
ranked in piles driven coral high. 
Where are the open windows – 
hingeless – unable to swing?
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Sick
Author: Michael Tilbury
the constant coughing, dead bodies
piling up outside beneath the window
from wars and greed
sedans slumped with corpses
mottled green on eggplant purple

the dustiness of the hellscapes I lived with
Afghanistan, Texas

break break

silver beard and a shotgun
baby blue and a rusted truck

invading my mind
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: What I do to control my anger
Author: Horsa
When I'm angry, singing, song-writing & poetry are my best friends.
I vent in rhyme or sing until my anger ends.
A crescendo is a good song to sing when I'm mad.
It mimics the way we express anger vocally without repercussions which are bad.
It starts off quiet & gets louder until it reaches a climax.
It's better than arguing with an old battle axe.
Singing a medley of songs which start quiet then get loud is another idea.
As these ways of venting aren't confrontational you can use them without fear.
They're better than getting violent or arguing the toss.
Violence & arguments always leave you at a loss.
Sometimes I just go for a walk.
Then when I'm calm I sit down & talk.
We solve the problems we couldn't when we were mad.
Problems solved calmly don't turn out as bad.
I hope this helps someone out.
Remember, you don't have to scream & shout.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: On My Way to the Picnic With Matilde
Author: Lonna Lewis Blodgett
Four legs quiver
like clumsy cabrioles
striking smooth gray rivers
of zig-zag sidewalk barrios
in rhythm with happy shivers
syncopated on a muffled drum
as we talk and stroll 

On our way
hand-in-hand 
we persuade and pretend 
this day away
taunting and cajoling to demand
laughing “hide and seeking”
chasing and skedaddling
poking and peeking
like cuddly pandas
or canoodling otters
splashing and clambering

We roll and meander
impetuously twiddling all the way 
atop gregarious green promenades 
we pause in slight delay 
as we prattle and prance
as we dance to the Crickets singing
nodding to their fiddling
frolicking with all the jiggling

Serendipitous stalks 
of snickering flowers pop
to dazzle and razzle our wits
we glide in stripes of candy bits 
of rainbows bright

Purple painted paisley
fragrantly flairs in pairs 
of scented lavender sweetness
among black-eyed daisies
dusting the woozy air
in a meadow’s billowing bloom
sunflowers sunbathe in costume 

We giddily tarry 
as we carry 
a feast of fancies and treats
artsy bits of charmed delicacies
filled with a peck of upcoming kisses
enticing fantasies that wink 

Snuggling shenanigans lead us astray
as we find our rootie-tootie hideaway 
hugs as we shy away
from tomfoolery jesting
to lay down and swoon
looking up at the soon to be stars
lingering for the coming of the moon

Murmurs of Starlings
gaggle their harmonies
of chirps
in cheeks and broadened beaks
thrumming tiny melodies.

Swallows sweep and woo
fixated on this unabashed swain 
through songbird strains
announcing a shrilling review
broadening in sweet refrains

“I love you…I love you”

Fingerpainting the Monet sky
puffy white cotton words appear
from clouds passing by
while tiny violins spin in the air 
piccolos peep 
pigeon-toed Doves coo and weep
their contentedness to appease
trailing off the pleasant breeze

I fall upon my knees

My words explode to strew
like a thousand storms set free

“I love you…I love you…I love you”
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Bother, Smother
Author: PhoenixRisingSun
gloss over posting
salute sing and bother
fought singed and ghost
pilgrimage silent daughter
passage feint and slaughter

toss the coin double sided
crickets molding echoes
shallow pool and gene stool
bothering, smothering
life and decay bellows
smoldering granite salt
gold sold and halt
Tell me? When does it start?
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Who Needs Princes?
Author: David Welch
Shannon watched a royal wedding
one afternoon on the TV,
the flowers, coaches, and garlands,
all the pomp and majesty,
the fancy gowns and ornate hats,
black-tie suits that fit handsomely,
noble steeds pulling carriages,
in her minds arose fantasies…

She saw herself in a ballroom
twirling ’round her paramour,
taking the hand of her suave prince,
in the arch of a gothic door,
cruising the warm Riviera
in a yacht that would leave most floored,
closets full of lovely dresses,
rows of the fanciest shoes galore.

She dreamed of sprawling palaces,
of servant to see to her whims,
four-poster bed, with chandelier,
to lie down and make love to him,
a gilded, bulging treasury,
gold and silver and jewels within;
all girls want to be princesses,
the thought of it still made her grin.

But then she recalled another
prince who had gone on a talk show,
airing all the dirty laundry,
sought to lay his family low,
and another caught cheating with
a stewardess while on the go,
the tabloids found out, ran wild,
until folks were all in the know.

She recalled the older prince who
folks said was a pedophile,
and how it all had been hushed up,
elites don’t like to stand trial,
and she saw how they lived planned lives,
schedules just weren’t her style,
and travelling without her kids,
not seeing them for long whiles?

It make her look out to the den,
on the couch slept her husband, Stan,
in his arms snoozed little Carmen;
as a father, none were more grand,
he worked, he sweat, he came off rough,
but always by her did he stand,
what need had Shannon of princes
when she’d landed herself a man.

Title: Lone bloom
Author: Bluewrite76
twilights a few ago 
sturdy farmer planted them seeds 
singing to the glory of the sun
gutsy voice carried along winds 
along came a tiny seed 
fell upon the curled leaf 
ferried to the wooded moor
orphaned from its golden ley 

yet tiny brave doll 
rose up in sugary optimism
head high among alien roots 
looking towards the sun 
eclipsed by wood giants 
he did his blessed part 
fed the hard worker bee 
baked his green kitchen breads
stocked up his seed larder 

waits on the lonely line 
for soft explorer palms 
to pick him up 
for his treasured resources 
or cradle him inside 
a book or potpuri 
until his communion with nature

Title: Witches of the bubbling pot
Author: Ella Lilja Blackrose
They stand round their bubbling pot,
it oozes green slime like liquid
which slops down the side
they crackle their spells and chant their laughter loud
for the moon is dark upon that starless sky of night
round their bubbling pot they dance
throwing the tails of rats and toes of frogs
and round the spin again their bubbling pot.

Title: Diversity Ripples
Author: Poetic Creations
guppy fish swim fast
while sailfin mollies dance the jig
breeding jack dempsey fight

within the sunlight soft-shelled turtles bask
as large alligators slide the river banks

emperor penguins walk upright
nesting eggs on cold bird toes
suitors walk circles
in dark, frozen, polar nights

ducks dive grubbing for muscles
white arctic foxes stalk white doves
wolves prey upon young caribou
polar bears catch ocean seal

dry lands host scorpions and snakes
as bat chatter echoes through the black

Title: Goat Five Band
Author: Ima Ryma
Levine and Flynn and Madden and
Carmichael and Valentine be
Named after the Maroon Five Band.
The alpine goats are family,
Welcoming visitors in on
The goat yard, so to know first hand
A one on one phenomenon,
With each and all boys in the band.
Here a "maa' there a "maa" be sung,
The sound of music echoes through.
Be careful not to step on dung
In the Farm at Lincoln Park Zoo.

Hear the goats "maa" and heed the call.
It will behoove you one and all.

Title: The Salt of the Earth
Author: TM Arko
Darkness accumulating
Pain upon the land
A dying force within
Blood on the nail-scarred hands
Three crosses silhouetted 
Against the ravaged skies
Salty thorns pierce the brow
Above the suffering eyes
Vinegar stings the parched lips
Speaking words so true
Father forgive them
For they know not what they do
Water and wine now flowing
From the wounded Lamb
The mockers who jeer not knowing
This is the great I AM
The purple robe divided
The lots that are cast
By all of the unaware
The first shall be the last
The final words are spoken
As death loses it's worth
He is the light of the world
He is the salt of the earth

Title: Nesting storks
Author: Rose Mary
When I return and time permits
I shall write of these white nesting storks
with their large bulky twigged nests dangling atop 
old cylinders of iron and wooded telegraph poles.

Their nursery lines the train track for miles and miles 
across the spread of land that flattens wide towards the narrow sea.
Plucked straight from childhood stories
they stand erect with folded black backed wings

Their dark eyes speak of ancient secrets
their long red bills of treasured dreams
And just before they outstretch  fingers into glide
their vast wings beat to the rock of the train
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Spring
Author: E Dilke
When the Spring tree peels open her leaf-fists
And spreads her green fingers out
Like stumped tentacles,
I listen.
But hear only the ewe's cry echo across the field,
as she weeps for her still-born lamb;
cold-grey against the rampant meadow,
beads of dew forming like fresh thoughts upon quivering blades of grass.

The Karma of Waste: a Sonnet
By
Kirk M. Puttlitz
Copyright 2021

A searchlight shines, despite the bright midday;
a ceiling fan spins in an empty room; 
an uneaten pork chop is tossed away;
a T.V. glimmers, but no one to view.

A cruiser in the garage, never ridden; 
a Fender in the corner, never strummed; 
a container in the attic, never opened;
a blazer in the closet, never donned.

The eye will wince at such disparity;
the mind, from guilt, and anger, will ponder;
the hand is forced into frugality
to spare the soul sequela for squander.

What is the final judgment to be faced? 
Damnation wrought by the Karma of Waste!

Title: For Ashley, on our Sixth Anniversary
Author: Carolina Chickadee
You held my hand like a barbed wire fence
Fiercely and on purpose
I nursed an iron vein
with the ruthless hunger of a new moon
Your love feels like a summer night
Hot and dark, wild and full of life 
I hold on for the lightning strike 
(Perhaps I was a tree in some past life)

Your fingers grip my hips 
An iris in slippery Atchafalaya clay
star-raked water blackly surging 
under the karstic nightgown of an aquifer 

Your fingers chiseled out my bones 
You draw me in 
Hold me like a diving breath 
Continents divide by their own devices

Prehistoric, divine
Bearing upwards soft as lava
All the violent secrets of creation

Title: The Orangutan’s Stag-Do, Hen-Night and Wedding
Author: Bob Pallister
It’s the orangutan’s stag-do 
The best-man’s booked a flight to Spain 
And has had printed the matching tee-shirts 
They’re all wearing on the plane
The slogan on a dozen chests
That’s attracting lots of gapes
To sum up their coming weekend says
“FOREIGN JAPES FOR ORANGE APES!!”

Meanwhile in a different airport
His bride to be and her hen-troupe fill the
Departure lounge in pink tutus
And “TEAM BRIDE” sashes in shiny silver

And in a week from now, providing they don’t falter
And their hangovers have lifted
They’ll meet for vows at the altar 
And two gold rings will be gifted 

No more queasiness from questionable quests 
For quaffing quick quenching that queers the digestion
Before her queenliness his quintessential test’s
To quickly quote “I do!” back to the quizzical question
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Alone with my telephone
Author: Ragepage........
Little sprinkles of rain falling, painting pictures in the dirt.
Dropping from the white gray clouds lightly on my fedora hat.
All memories pass as they dry under beams of sunlight.
Everything last till all the bones wither and turn brittle.
Like the petals of the flowers fallen to the ground.
The dead leaves are blown, scattered by the winds.
As the concoctions of man dwindle into the abyss of the ocean.
I sit silently in the mist of stormy weather waiting for clear skies.
Viewing the world from my telephone screen.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: of toads and periwinkles of summers past
Author: Jon Nakapalau
I have not seen a toad in my backyard for years
But summers past they use to hide in the cool periwinkle

Jumping and then disappearing into another patch
While my mother would water the plants

I would try to find them under the velvet crops
Hands bedewed and black with soil

They would scamper away deeper into purple hiding places
“Be careful with the plants” my mother would say

Next to the earth they were often hard to find
A stone or a chip of wood that would suddenly jump away

The periwinkles are gone too
A casualty of California droughts

Silicon Valley ghost flora and fauna.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Daft the Centurion
Author: Radiobravo
bars locked and shut under guise of threat
hums of melodic fruit wither and dry to ash
fluid mind turned to heavy bolder stone
crushing the neck to a stiff totemic ward

laser eyes peer with wrinkling lids
melted dancing smirks to droopy cheeks
pointed ears cavernous plugged from the wind
maiden horns germ through wafting mane

brothers killed and sisters lost from sight
maimed with thick hard headed assault
flakes of skin brush floating to the sink
accompanied by kraken face staring back

he stares daggers as the voices vanish
screaming hot saliva to drown the dawn
he pleads with his sweaty shattered eyes
to speak soft speech and chain trickster lies

a naked monster gazes collapsed furrowed brows
striking deafening gavels points to a metal prison
piercing my pupils with curled lash beam
stomps the feet soiled earth swallowing the stand

waters from skin dancing in the glistening morn
knob's cross turn as faucet spills the heat
splashing the warmth to wipe the calloused lids
and smear the steaming hand print on the mirror
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: If
Author: brett masters
if the clocks were turned back
to the days of my youth 
still fresh faced and clear
if given leave to restart the game
I would cast off this dull land
to be far away

a farmhouse with red tiled roofs
angled and time worn 
Tuscany or Umbria would suit 
scatterings of grey olive trees 
a vineyard fluttering with ripening vines
and a stone barn in which to work 

I would call out to le belle ragazze
flowering in their Primavera of youth
come sit to my delighted eye
come laugh and drink wine 
be my joyous conspirators 
in repainting the youthful dreams of Spring
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: A Warm Up
Author: Cp Culliton
An overcast spring afternoon, 
little leaves and flowers pop out of bark brown trees, 
sprinkling subtle pastel colors everywhere,
filling up branches and treetop skylines, 
as crocuses and daffodils peak out looking for sunshine, 
all they feel is a late winter cold sticking around
encroaching even further still, 
inhibiting growth. 

Decisions are being made,
hands are held tighter, 
layers are kept from storage, 
it's still boot season in all the northern cities. 

Only the hardiest order iced coffee,
not wearing gloves, 
powering through, 
championing chills in the fingers, nose, and throat,
as breezes consisting of cigarettes, tailpipes, laundry dryers, 
and the precious natural gas fumes escaping out tenement windows 
the landlord won’t bother to seal,
fall back again behind buildings and down the river, 
finally coalescing into the harbor, and out to sea.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: About My Dog
Author: Cole Doyle
My dog does his stride-alongside-me plead,
the forever-tongue-hung-over-lip smile.
Brown ears smooth like the smallest pencil strokes,
fur-brows sit a roof on olive-black eyes.
He’s fast, an overheating sweat engine,
a wind-up wag-tail and small hot exhaust breath,
a white blur—or blunder; blossom blender.
He’s a weather walker through rain or shine,
a house trailing soaked dish rag and paw mop,
monster truck growl sounds and deep midnight snores,
wet floor painter and tummy-up snoozer.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Green Grass
Author: Francine 1
Verdant fields with pea green sea grass growing tall
pine valleys with evergreens fragrant both large and small
mountain paths with wild flowers on tall emerald stems
or tropical beaches with ash-green palms with swaying ends.
lush green grass of various hues on lawns back home
green grass of home.
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Κλέος
Author: Pixiepop343
I dreamed again,
Telemachus –
Fresh laurels writhed 
Across my brow
Where undead wreaths
Of woven wounds
Once proudly rode
In gold; green boughs
Stretch grimly grown
Anew, crushing with
Fierce and piercing
Limbs through temples
And aging scars.
Blood blackens a veil
Across my view,
And bathes the grasping
Shoots; full formed 
And fledged and fringed
And freed, and furling
Forth with silv’ry veins
To rustle from
My skull; each root
Embraces each 
A rib; my hand, 
Out-reached – bud-tipped,
Where fingertips
Once began.
How can I
Touch you now?
The knotted wands 
Wind tangled through
Her waiting web -
Penelope’s -
How many tens
And tens of tides
Have wept and wrought
That weft? How sore
And sick and bitter
Rued, this voyage
Begun in salt!
I would I’d undo
Each howling soul
I’ve won and reft
For this shivering
Crown; I would
That the salt of
My dying could scour
My glory to ash and
My branches to fire;
Please – don’t make me
Dream anymore!
Let me wake in her arms.

Title: ''Relaxation Hawaiian Islands''
Author: Norma St John Poetress
Here we go a hammock on the whiten
petals pearls shimmer and glimmered 
sandstones paradise.

Peaks of pieces of sounded nature's wilder
fallen moments into the arms of his
beachbody oceans seasonings beauty.

Palm green trees sway cool breeze air
freshly smells waits morning rising sun
sunsets cloudscape blue dancing stars and 
moon smiles.

Wedding bells on the beach sands as we walk 
hand in hand of truiest souling mindset stilliness
breakfast on the beach mid early morning red 

orange risen deeper desperately dells pleasant 
valleys island far away.

Title: old boots
Author: Thomas Cham bers
old boots 
worn to bits
carried butts
married to the land

flecks of gold and brown
dotting taut laces 
their traces on 
men's hands
kicked off in a warm corner 
somewhere in winter

famous collectors of stones and nails
tough work and seldom clean
God knows where old boots have been
------------------------------------------------------------

Title: For Avila Beach, for Johann
Author: Magdalena Munro
The gentle sea laps
anchored boats  —

asleep in a hushed
and misty newborn 
bay.

We draw the vista in
and count the naked 
masts.

Brown stilts in silt
stand tall and round
and creak near beaks 
perched on the tiptop. 

Your path, unsown  —
now weeps for familial
fields unknown.

Below, a sturdy steadfast
rock juts high in frothy
greens.

Newborn waves now form
white curls and your wise 
dear hazelspun eyes are dry.
------------------------------------------------------------

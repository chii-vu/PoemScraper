Title: Day's End
Author: WilI

I’m April rain and sunburst July
nightmare October’s duress;
sparring ages in grey-eyed September
Tropics.

Caught monarchs of her love
as they migrated city pastures
caught pappus, cherry blossoms, primeval
winds.

Blue haze pierced hazel pupils
monstrous daylight consumes after
anemic thunderstorms, gluttonous star
eater

Inhale gusts and mild cloud’s saliva
exchange healing hatreds
topple distant forests, end doomed
days.

Assist my horrors expansion
czar valentine, comrade cupid
sickle my closing aperture
soon

Cudgel nights remorse
force all I feel to manifest
not from a page or a drink
But from me.

Title: Downpour
Author: KindPoet

Giant raindrops 
assaulted the windshield
with magnified rage.

The clouds overhead 
snickered at the
small sleeping town.

I gripped my steering wheel 
as the lightening 
danced above me,
biting the black sky
with its jagged white teeth.

Thunder shouted threats
downwards,
its bellow cracking 
the clouds apart.

Slowly
I drove home,
defeating the storm’s
unyielding violence.

Title: Introduction to Poetry
Author: Billy Collins

I ask them to take a poem
	and hold it up to the light
	like a color slide

	 

	or press an ear against its hive.

	 

	I say drop a mouse into a poem
	and watch him probe his way out,

	or walk inside the poem's room
	and feel the walls for a light switch.

	 

	I want them to waterski
	across the surface of a poem
	waving at the author's name on the shore.

	But all they want to do
	is tie the poem to a chair with rope
	and torture a confession out of it.

	 

	They begin beating it with a hose
	to find out what it really means.

Title: Dancing in moonlight
Author: Nopoints

A big bright silver moon lights up the dark night sky
Beaming its torch light across the rippling sea shore
While old oak trees dance with their shadows along city footpaths
and their golden leaves rustle along the floor

Title: not goodbye, until we meet again
Author: Nuno Cardoso

The love that resides inside 
the eyeballs that weep for foreign tongues 
soon to depart back to the dark-grey 
thunder-filled cloudy Portugal sky 
a star that swims within 
the fizz of water that sparkles and falls 
on cats that bake high-noon cookies 
with their paws on California Kingsize white ovens.

it's where butterflies die 
but wedding rings breathe,
the same place where children laugh and scream,
and where grins rejoice with corn on the cob 
floating on Caldo de res alongside partisan carrots,
little Red La Soda potatoes with the skin still on, 
rice stained with broth, and love, and TexMex you.

Title: You and Yew in the Morning Dew
Author: Obumbrata

An echoing strike our neighbors hear,
skips the canopies and dances on roofs.
Crimson flows over callus and twisted bole,
creatures entombed, except you.
Salt gathers on the ridge,
I tremble and cool you from above.

You and Yew in the morning dew.

You rest your tool and brew the leaves,
they belong to you.
You look away from me,
the wind moans through my hollow self.
I wish not for your heart to rot,
those sulfur tongues have already licked me.

You and Yew in the morning dew.

The dampened thud cuts deeper,
the aching roots begin to speak.
Limbs buckle and snap,
burdenless at last.
Wet earth splatters and encases,
a coffin of detritus and decay.

You and Yew in the evening dew.

I am what you end,
you are too.
I am the sip of what you bring,
you are too.
Gaze down on the nearby nourishing silver pane,
we are like the echo of that first strike.

You and Yew in the evening dew.

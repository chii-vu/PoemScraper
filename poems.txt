Title: Paul's Ride
Author: Matthew T.

Dank and oaken, scant of light 
Cobbled floors stained of the fight

Silver goblets and a schillings full
A head of steam, and a nation's pull

Lager and rum, slosh and dance
An unknown man who grinds his lance

The belfry's glow, a signal given
He digs his heels, the horse is driven

Silence lost in approaching fear
A man named Paul soon would appear 

Now gather men, take up the fight
Rally you kin throughout the night 

They drove them back and held their land
Armed with courage, and God's own hand

Title: Imaginary Friends
Author: Kābird

My traveling uncle brought me gifts back from Spain:
Juanita the flamenco dancer, and Pedro the mighty bullfighter,
along with a colorful sequined skirt, and some blue castanets.

Guitars played as Juanita and I twirled fancifully about.
Pedro's red cape danced and many a bull fell at his feet. 
Juanita's beauty, Pedro's sword, and I still play the castanets.

Title: Sonnet 130: 'My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun...'
Author: William Shakespeare

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;

Coral is far more red than her lips' red:

If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;

If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.

I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,

But no such roses see I in her cheeks;

And in some perfumes is there more delight

Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.

I love to hear her speak, yet well I know

That music hath a far more pleasing sound.

I grant I never saw a goddess go:

My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.

   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare

   As any she belied with false compare.

Title: Until The Next Time
Author: KennyW

Is this the field where the men lay dead
where arms and legs and torsos bled
with broken bones and severed heads
death by spears and arrows and by lead
we tally the scores before rumours spread
march onward to the next battle just ahead

Title: Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos
Author: Terry Volbrecht

Last night I dreamed
I was crossing a footbridge,
its grey old boards 
cracked and creaking,
and winding to the left
across a tree-filled valley
with varied greens flecked 
with glowing sprays
of russet and amber.

Under the bridge
I saw a sloping bank 
of black rocks
sinking into the dark.

My eye lit on a singular stone,
split open to reveal
an oval of gold.

This morning I was writing,
bleary-eyed and aching,
when I heard a rustling 
in the hakea tree
outside my study window.
Looking up,
I saw the tree heaving
as if caught 
in a turbulent gale.

But there was no wind.
In the still autumnal air
I saw eight yellow-tailed
black cockatoos
and clearly heard 
the crackle and crunch
of their gleeful beaks
as they ate hakea seeds
and let a few green leaves,
untouched by the fall.
tumble down to earth.
